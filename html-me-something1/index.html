<p class="center">Growing up, hundreds of thousands of young athletes dream of playing college sports. Then reality sets in. Everyone on your JV basketball team isnâ€™t getting a full ride to North Carolina or UCLA. There comes a time when your illustrious high school sports career comes to end. There are no more halftime oranges or road trips on the short yellow bus. Only a select few athletes continue on to the college level, others are left to imagine what could have been. From the outside looking in college student-athletes seem to be indulged in a lifestyle similar to the rich and famous. It seems that for a college student-athlete just about everything is free, and if you need someone to hold your hand for four years, that can be arranged. Life for a college student-athlete would seem to be easy. I realize that I am fortunate to be in the position I am. I earned a full athletic scholarship to a four-year university. Many people would love to be where I am. I get paid to play football, in the grand scheme of things I donâ€™t have a lot to complain about, but the life of a college student-athlete is far from easy.

        Once you learn to quit, it becomes a habit.</p>
